# HH's PFTWD
This is just a personal web-dev project that I'm trying to build myself with a tiny amount of help from AI. It will be a personal finance tracking web application developed with libraries and dependencies that I have learnt during my Polytechnic and Year-long Internship.
- Frontend: React, Next.js, MUI, and TailwindCSs
- Backend: Next.JS and Prisma
- Database: Neon DB PostgreSQL
